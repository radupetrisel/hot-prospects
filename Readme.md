# Hot Prospects

This is project 16 of 100 Days of SwiftUI by Paul Hudson (link [here](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/hot-prospects-introduction)). This is an app to track who you meet at conferences.

As usual, at the end of the guided tutorial there will be three challenges for me to implement on my own.

## Challenges

**Challenge #1**: Add an icon to the “Everyone” screen showing whether a prospect was contacted or not.

**Challenge #2**: Use JSON and the documents directory for saving and loading our user data.

**Challenge #3**: Use a confirmation dialog to customize the way users are sorted in each tab – by name or by most recent.
