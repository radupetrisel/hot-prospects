# Hot Prospects

This is project 16 of 100 Days of SwiftUI by Paul Hudson (link [here](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/hot-prospects-introduction)). This is an app to track who you meet at conferences.

As usual, at the end of the guided tutorial there will be three challenges for me to implement on my own.
